# Conway's Game Of Life - Python Project

This project is a personnal initative to improve myself at programming in python and do more algos.
This version actually works, it has some interesting features and I'm proud to say that every project that I do are 100% handmade with not any single of code taken from an other project, no video tutoriel and no AI to help me.

I'll share all my researchs sources to succeed this project.

There are a lot of features and algo that I can improve on this code, I personnaly have a list of things to change in this code as for optimize the code execution and make it lighter for the computer to run for exemple.

I'll make update on this project as I would like to improve the features and why not try to make something a bit closer to LENIA.


## Features

- Press "Spacebar' to pause or play the game. It'll freeze the game of life process and allow you to place live cells by yourself.
- Right Click on a cell to make it live while the game is on pause

## Installing Pygame

To run my code you must have to install pygame on your computer, by running the line on your gitbash or python bash.

```bash
  python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
